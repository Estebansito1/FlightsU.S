# FlightsU.S
Our project aims to develop an Airline Management System using Java and Eclipse. This system will offer a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of an airline's operations, including flight destination, passenger information handling, transactions, baggage, boarding passes, and additional passenger options. The system will provide a user friendly interface for both administrators and users, ensuring a smooth and efficient operations for the airline.

Objectives:

• Develop a robust and user-friendly interface for managing airline operations.
• Design a GUI for flight scheduling, and passenger handling.
• Ensure data integrity and security by implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
• Provide booking confirmations and other relevant information at time of booking.
• Optimize system performance to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently.
• Facilitate easy integration with other systems such as payments, option selections, and meal selections.

Features:

• Booking Management: Enables users to search for flights, book tickets, and manage their bookings.
• Passenger Handling: Stores passenger information securely and manages check-in processes.
• Notifications: Sends automated notifications to users regarding booking confirmations, flight delays, and other relevant updates.
• Integration: Supports integration with external systems for payment processing, flight tracking, and other services.

Conclusion:

The proposed Airline Management System will streamline the operations of the airline, enhance user experience, and improve overall efficiency. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices, we aim to deliver a high-quality solution that meets the needs of both the airline and its passengers
